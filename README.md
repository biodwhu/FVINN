During the dim 2020, an epidemic plagued human all over the world, which was caused by a notorious virus  SARS-CoV-2 . Since some foreseeing reports suppose this disaster to be long lasting, drugs to resist its further attack has been an urgent demand. While new drug discovery remains a long process. Exploring known drugs may be an alternatively effective way to assist facing this challenge. In this study, we propose a neural-network model which can predict drug-target affinity to screen some drugs with high affinity to some target of SARS-CoV-2. Features are abstracted from their own characters and their interaction based on sequence. The model is supported efficacious on KIBA and Davis database, with better Mean
Squared Error (MSE), Concordance Index (CI) and r2 than DeepDTA and AttentionDTA. This model helps to find some potential drugs with higher affinity to some of 21 targets of SARS-CoV-2.
