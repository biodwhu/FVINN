During the dim 2020, an epidemic plagued human all over the world, which was caused by a notorious virus SARS-CoV-2. Since some foreseeing reports suppose this disaster to be long lasting, drugs to resist its further attack has been an urgent demand. While new drug discovery remains a long process. Exploring known moleculars may be an alternatively effective way to assist facing this challenge. In this study, we propose a ﬁngerprint and virtual interaction neural network (FVINN) model for predicting drug-target afﬁnity to assist screening drugs with high afﬁnity to some target of SARS-CoV2, which may own the potentiality to deactivate SARS-Cov2. The drug ﬁngerprint is calculated as circular ﬁngerprints by RDkit. The protein ﬁngerprint is generated by clustering patterns in protein sequence with distance of similarity for appearing together. The virtual interaction feature is generated by performing attentional mechanism on the one-dimension convoltional result of drug and protein sequence. The model is proved efﬁcacious on two drugCtarget afﬁnity benchmark datasets, KIBA and Davis datasets, with better Mean Squared Error(MSE),ConcordanceIndex(CI)and r2 thanDeepDTAand AttentionDTA. We ﬁnally give a case for this model to ﬁnd some potential drugs with high afﬁnity to target site Spike on SARSCoV-2, in which one has been conﬁrmed potential for inhibiting the virus according to CHEMBL website.
